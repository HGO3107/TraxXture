A tracking device with **remote interior capturing capabilty**

## 🔥 Features  
- **Real-time location tracking** – Get your vehicle’s location on demand  
- **Motion sensing & speed monitoring** – Know when your vehicle is on the move  
- **Battery Backup and health monitoring** – Keep track of power levels  
- **Remote interior capturing** – Snap image of your vehicle’s interior when needed  
- **Offline storage** – Data backup, even without an internet connection  
- **Reverse polarity protection** – To ensure the device does not get affected should incase the vehicle pollarity is mistakenly swapped  

## 🏗️ Project Structure  
📂 **Main Board** – The brains of the operation
📂 **Cam-Interconnect Board** – The bridge between the camera and the system  
📂 **Rendered Images** – Stunning visuals of the design  

## 🔧 Main Board – What's Inside?  
The **Main Board** packs all the essentials:  
✅ **Microcontroller, sensors, and actuator circuitry**  
✅ **LVDS driver/receiver port** – Ensures **3-5m** long-distance camera communication  

## 📸 Cam-Interconnect Board  
This board connects the camera to the system using:  
✅ **LVDS to SPI converter**  
✅ **Camera port connector**  

## 🚧 Disclaimer; Work in Progress (Status: **DRAFT** 🚀)  
Still some work to do, Below are what I could think of, you can pick it up from here if insterested:  

🔲 **Generate BOM & Fabrication files**  
🔲 **Review schematics & PCB layouts**  
🔲 **Complete the Cam-Interconnect Board:**  
   - PCB layout  
   - Electrical Rule Check (ERC) & Design Rule Check (DRC)  
🔲 **Finalize the enclosure design** (Done in FreeCAD but needs tweaks for connectors)
